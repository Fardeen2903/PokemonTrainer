# PokemonTrainer


A simple Python application that allows users to input Pokémon power values and calculates the minimum and maximum power in the list. The application features a fun, Pokémon-themed graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## Features

- **Pokémon-themed GUI**: The interface is decorated with a Pokémon logo and styled with a light blue background.
- **Power Calculation**: Users can input Pokémon power values, and the program will calculate and display the minimum and maximum power values.
- **Web-based Image**: The Pokémon logo is loaded directly from an online image URL, so users do not need to provide a local file path.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python packages installed:

- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- Pillow (`PIL`)
- Requests (for fetching the Pokémon logo from the web)

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pillow requests
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd PokemonTrainer
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python pokemontrainer.py
```

4. The graphical interface will appear, where you can enter Pokémon power values and see the minimum and maximum powers calculated.
